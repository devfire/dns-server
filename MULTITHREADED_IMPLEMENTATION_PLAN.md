# Multithreaded DNS Server Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to transform the current single-threaded DNS server into a truly multithreaded, high-performance DNS resolver capable of handling thousands of concurrent queries.

## Current Architecture Analysis

**Current Bottleneck**: The main loop in `main.rs:75-211` processes DNS queries sequentially:
```rust
loop {
    let (len, addr) = sock.recv_from(&mut buf).await?;  // Blocks until packet received
    // Process packet synchronously
    // Send response
}
```

**Performance Impact**: Each query blocks the entire server until completion, limiting throughput to ~100 queries/sec.

## 1. Core Architecture Changes

### Main Loop Refactoring (`main.rs:75-211`)
**Objective**: Replace blocking loop with task spawning architecture

**Current Implementation**:
- Sequential processing in main loop
- Each query waits for previous query completion
- Single point of failure

**New Implementation**:
```rust
loop {
    let (len, addr) = sock.recv_from(&mut buf).await?;
    let packet_data = buf[..len].to_vec();
    let query_handle = query_actor_handle.clone();
    let sock_clone = sock.clone(); // Arc<UdpSocket>
    
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        process_dns_query(packet_data, addr, query_handle, sock_clone).await;
    });
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Each incoming UDP packet spawns independent task
- Main loop becomes purely packet reception and task dispatch
- Concurrent processing of multiple queries

### Task Isolation Strategy
- Create `process_dns_query()` function to handle individual queries
- Move packet decoding, resolution, and response logic into spawned tasks
- Ensure each task is self-contained and isolated

## 2. Shared State Management

### UdpSocket Sharing
**Challenge**: Multiple tasks need to send responses via same socket

**Solution**:
- Wrap `UdpSocket` in `Arc<UdpSocket>` for thread-safe sharing
- Each spawned task gets cloned reference for response sending
- Tokio's UdpSocket is already thread-safe for concurrent operations

### QueryActorHandle Management
**Current State**: Already implements `Clone` trait
**Strategy**: 
- Safe to clone across tasks
- Consider implementing connection pooling for better throughput
- Each task gets independent handle to actor system

### Thread Safety Considerations
- All shared components use tokio's async-safe primitives
- No additional synchronization required for basic implementation
- Actor pattern already provides message-passing concurrency

## 3. Connection Pooling Strategy

### Multiple QueryActor Instances
**Objective**: Eliminate single QueryActor bottleneck

**Current Limitation**: Single QueryActor processes all DNS resolutions
**Solution**: Create pool of QueryActor instances

```rust
struct QueryActorPool {
    actors: Vec<QueryActorHandle>,
    current: AtomicUsize,
    size: usize,
}

impl QueryActorPool {
    fn new(pool_size: usize, resolver: Resolver<TokioConnectionProvider>) -> Self {
        let actors = (0..pool_size)
            .map(|_| QueryActorHandle::new(resolver.clone()))
            .collect();
        
        Self {
            actors,
            current: AtomicUsize::new(0),
            size: pool_size,
        }
    }
    
    fn get_actor(&self) -> &QueryActorHandle {
        let index = self.current.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed) % self.size;
        &self.actors[index]
    }
}
```

### Distribution Strategies
- **Round-robin**: Simple, even distribution
- **Least-busy**: More complex, better load balancing
- **Recommended**: Start with round-robin, optimize later

### Pool Sizing
- **Recommended**: 10-50 actors depending on expected load
- **Consideration**: Each actor maintains resolver connection
- **Tuning**: Monitor connection pool utilization

## 4. Resource Management

### Task Limits
**Problem**: Unlimited task spawning can exhaust system resources

**Solution**: Implement semaphore-based limiting
```rust
use tokio::sync::Semaphore;

static QUERY_SEMAPHORE: Semaphore = Semaphore::const_new(1000);

// In main loop:
let permit = QUERY_SEMAPHORE.acquire().await.unwrap();
tokio::spawn(async move {
    let _permit = permit; // Hold permit for task duration
    process_dns_query(packet_data, addr, query_handle, sock_clone).await;
});
```

**Recommended Limits**:
- Development: 100-500 concurrent queries
- Production: 1000-5000 concurrent queries
- Adjust based on available memory and CPU cores

### Memory Management
**Optimizations**:
- Use `BytesMut` efficiently to avoid excessive allocations
- Consider buffer pooling for high-throughput scenarios
- Monitor memory usage per task

**Buffer Pool Implementation** (Optional):
```rust
use tokio::sync::Mutex;

struct BufferPool {
    buffers: Mutex<Vec<Vec<u8>>>,
    buffer_size: usize,
}
```

## 5. Error Handling & Resilience

### Task Isolation
**Benefits**:
- Failed tasks don't crash entire server
- Graceful handling of malformed packets
- Individual query timeouts

**Implementation**:
```rust
tokio::spawn(async move {
    let result = tokio::time::timeout(
        Duration::from_secs(30),
        process_dns_query(packet_data, addr, query_handle, sock_clone)
    ).await;
    
    match result {
        Ok(_) => {}, // Success
        Err(_) => tracing::warn!("Query timeout for {}", addr),
    }
});
```

### Graceful Degradation
**Circuit Breaker Pattern**:
- Track upstream DNS resolver failures
- Temporarily disable failing resolvers
- Fallback to alternative resolvers

**Fallback Responses**:
- Return SERVFAIL for resolution failures
- Implement basic error response generation
- Log errors for monitoring

### Timeout Management
**Query Timeouts**: 5-30 seconds per query
**Resolution Timeouts**: Configure in hickory-resolver
**Connection Timeouts**: Handle at actor level

## 6. Performance Optimizations

### Async I/O Efficiency
**Current**: Single-threaded UDP operations
**Optimization**: Leverage tokio's async I/O

**Advanced Options**:
- Consider `io_uring` backend on Linux for maximum performance
- Batch response sending where possible
- Use vectored I/O for multiple responses

### Future Enhancements
**Caching Layer**:
- Add Redis or in-memory cache for frequent queries
- TTL-based cache invalidation
- Cache hit ratio monitoring

**Load Balancing**:
- Multiple upstream DNS servers
- Health checking and failover
- Geographic DNS routing

## 7. Monitoring & Metrics

### Concurrent Operations Tracking
**Key Metrics**:
- Active task count
- Query processing latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Throughput (queries per second)
- Upstream resolver health

**Implementation**:
```rust
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicU64, Ordering};

static ACTIVE_QUERIES: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);
static TOTAL_QUERIES: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);

// In query processing:
ACTIVE_QUERIES.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
// ... process query ...
ACTIVE_QUERIES.fetch_sub(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
TOTAL_QUERIES.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
```

### Resource Monitoring
**System Metrics**:
- Memory usage per task
- Connection pool utilization
- Error rates by query type
- Response time distribution

**Logging Strategy**:
- Structured logging with tracing
- Query-level tracing spans
- Performance metrics export
